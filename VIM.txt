* To say the truth I don't know why it's powerful. But the majority says so then let's explore



Vim has two mode: COMMAND and INSERT

when entered INSERT mode, there will be --INSERT-- in bottom of the command line interface.
to go back COMMAND mode, just hit ESCAPE!

1. Navigate the text:
          ^
       <     >
          v
